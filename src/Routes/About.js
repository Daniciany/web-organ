            <p>Web-Organ:</p>
            <p>Web Organ can of course not replicate an original hammond organ, but it is a way of recreating it's concepts</p>
            <p>It has nine drawbars (with 9 volume settings each), like any other electro-mechanical organ</p>
            <p>Of course there is the iconic vibrato-chorus dial with 3 settings for vibrato and 3 settings for chorus. Just toggle it below the power button</p>
            <p>what also must not be missing: Web Organ has a complete percussion simulation on demand...</p>
            <p>Web Organ could be capable of playing pretty much any frequency, but the real hammond was limited to 109 different frequencies, so web organ also has harmonic foldback working in the background</p>
